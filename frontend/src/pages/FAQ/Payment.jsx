              <b>Payment methods include PayPal and Credit cards.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              PayPal is a safer, easier way to send and receive money online.
              When you select PayPal as the payment method, you will be linked
              to the PayPal site where you can make payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              PayPal can be used to purchase items by Credit Card (Visa,
              MasterCard, Discover, and American Express), Debit Card, or
              E-check (i.e. using your regular Bank Account).
            </p>
            <p>
              1) After viewing your items on your shopping cart page, you can
              click and check out with PayPal. Then you will leave our site and
              enter PayPal’s website.
              <br />
              2) You can sign in to your PayPal account, or you can create a new
              one if you haven’t got one.
              <br />
              3) You can use the PayPal as you want according to the on-screen
              instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, PayPal e-check will take 3-5 business days to be
              confirmed by PayPal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The reasons why we suggest you use PayPal:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment is traceable. By using your PayPal account, you can trace
              the status of your payment.
              <br />
              When you make payment for your order, you don’t need to use your
              credit card online (you can transfer directly from your bank
              account). When you use your credit card through PayPal, nobody
              will see your credit card number, which will minimize the risk of
              unauthorized use.
            </p>
            <p>
              The store may also accept credit cards for the payment. In order
              to accept credit card payments, the store complies with the
              industry security standards established by the major credit card
              companies (American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, and Visa)
              to protect the buyers from cardholder information theft.
            </p>
            <p>
              All credit card information is kept to a minimum. The storage and
              retention of any credit card information is limited to what is
              required for business operations only. Access to credit card
              information is strictly limited to those employees who are
              authorized and trained to use it for the business purposes.
